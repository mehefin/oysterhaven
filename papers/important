I use a fork of dmenu: clean dmenu, so be careful with the dmenu config file and better install the fork - https://github.com/migueravila/CleanDmenu.
There is one trick I did, polybar has now its borders transparent, thanks to picom, so if you turn off picom, polybar borders will no longer be transparent.
Setxkbmap line inside of i3wm config will be useful for those who are not native english speakers and would like to switch their keyboard layout
by pressing alt and shift, just put your country code instead of "ie", for instance, fr for french layout, de for german layout, ru for russian layout, and 
so forth, just google your country code to know. By the way, in this rice, for polybar and terminal, I use a font called "Hermit", 
you can also find it in my first git branch. Enjoy it.
